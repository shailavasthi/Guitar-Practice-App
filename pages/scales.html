				<h1 class='display-3 text-center'>Scales</h1>
				<p class='lead text-justify'>The general steps to learning a new scale pattern are as follows: First, drill the pattern into your muscle memory by playing it up and down in various patterns. Next, begin crafting your own musical lines within the pattern. Finally, since the end goal of learning scales is to solo over chord progressions, use the new pattern to solo over a progression in the appropriate key. You can do this by playing along to songs, recording a progression on a looper pedal, or looking up backing tracks on YouTube</p>

				<h2 class=''>Chord Tones</h2>
				<p class='lead'>For Advanced Players</p>
				<p class='text-justify'>When a player has can solo over any chord progession using the appropriate major scale and all of its modes joined together accross the fretboard, this player should begin studying the use of chord tones. Their soloing skills will be greatly enhanced when they can learn how to target various chord tones in their solo based on what chord in the progression they are playing over. </p>
